# Tutorial 1

This introductory tutorial will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development.

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to set up installations for your [local development environment](./1_INSTALL.md)
- to get comfortable with the [Github workflow](./2_GIT_SETUP.md)
- to learn how to [serve](./3_BASIC_SERVER.md) your pages so that you can see/interact with them while you are coding

## Week 1 Assignment:

- [ ] Replicate this environment on your own computer. You should leverage the files present in the root of this directory in your repository (`tutorial1_getting_started/` [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), [main.js](main.js))
   1. First, confirm you have all the [installations](./1_INSTALL.md) on your machine. If you have no errors, proceed to the next step.
   2. While logged in to your github username, follow the [github workflow](./2_GIT_SETUP.md) to fork this repository into your own account.
   3. Ensure that you can [serve](./3_BASIC_SERVER.md) locally.
- [ ] Using your local server, update the language in the `console log`. Pick anything at all -- but it should be different than 'Hello World!' to show that your javascript code changes are connected to your site. You should see this in the browser inspector of your local serve.
- [ ] Push these changes up to your forked repository. You should see your commit and any code changes in the github repo.
- [ ] Post your code and deployed links to the Tutorial 1 post on the Commons.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Use the javascript file to explore javascript syntax. Console log any more interesting findings, such as the result of a function.
- [ ] Test out your HTML/CSS knowledge to render a welcome to class messsage using the `index.html` file.

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://interactivedatavis2021.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your commited code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)

To receive full credit, you must post your stable path before the 12pm the day of the next class.
